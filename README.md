# Full Stack FastAPI

This project presents how to work with FastAPI on a monorepo setup.

## Usage

You should be able to run the `blog` service with:

```bash
./pants run --docker-run-args="-p 8000:8000" src/docker/blog:main
```

## Notes

This is still work in progress. I'll update this README during the development.

Watch the repository if interested to see the development. I'll be careful with the commit history.
